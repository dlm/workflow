# workflow

`workflow` is my personal workflow tooling project: small utilities that help me
automate and standardize my day-to-day developer workflow.

The main interface is `wk`, a CLI that smooths friction around nix, direnv,
vcs, etc.

## What belongs in this repo

Tools belong in this repo if they:
1) are part of my daily workflow, and
2) benefit from sharing conventions/config/state with `wk`.

This repo is not a dumping ground for unrelated scripts.
